- Using FDJASVS X Bootstrapper will NOT get you banned as long as you do not use any of the hacking presets or change the ROBLOX Download Channel.
  - We also do NOT encourage you to use any of the hacking presets, if you do wanna use them, do it at Your Own Risk.
- FDJASVS X Bootstrapper is NOT and will NOT be malware, We just want to offer you features that Bloxstrap doesn't.
  - BloxInstaller Is Also Safe. It Is Closed-Source, But You can Check FDJASVS X Bootstrapper's Source Code to see what commands does It Execute(search up `EmeraldGG` in the search bar) 
- To Enable Developer Mode, Click The Wrench Icon In FDJASVS X Bootstrapper's Main Window
  - I'd Also Like To Point Out That You Should Use Developer Mode With Caution, Some Of The Features In It Can Get You Banned. Have Fun! 
- Unfortunately, FDJASVS X Bootstrapper only Works on Windows and does not offer Support for MacOS, Linux Or Any Other Operating System. Apologies to any non-windows user out there.
